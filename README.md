Programing Basics with Java

The "Programming Basics" course provides the initial programming skills necessary for all technology majors at Software University. This includes writing entry-level programming code (basic coding skills), working with a development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using of conditional constructions (if, if-else) and loops (for, while, do-while).

The skills we aacquire:

•	Working with the console (data input and output)

•	Working with loops (for)

•	Work with more complex logical checks

•	Working with logical checks (if-else)

•	Perform simple calculations

•	Working with more complex loops (nested for loops and while)
